# Currently live @ [MindBoard](https://coffeescrpt.github.io/MindBoard/)
A very simple and interactive website to create your very own mind maps, graphs & notes. <br>
I had an assigment forcing me to create a mind map and I had zero clue what it is and how to make one so I turned this into an entire simple HTML that helps me make it pretty, lol. <br>

Publishing it so perhaps you too may use it for your endearing window graphs. <br>

You can:

Dynamically add unlimited amount of windows that are editable to your liking as well as movable around, <br>
Draw around on the canvas in chosen color, <br>
Clear pen canvas with a singular button <br>
